# Modern Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project** repository! 🚀  
This project showcases a **modern data warehouse** built using **SQL Server**, covering **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Data Modeling, and Analytics**. Designed as a portfolio project, it follows industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

---
## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture** with three structured layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested from multiple sources (CSV files, APIs, databases) into SQL Server.
2. **Silver Layer**: Processes and cleanses data, ensuring consistency and quality before transformation.
3. **Gold Layer**: Optimized for analytics, structured in a **Star Schema** for efficient querying and reporting.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **ETL Pipelines**: Automating data ingestion, transformation, and loading into SQL Server.
2. **Data Modeling**: Designing **fact and dimension tables** to support analytical queries.
3. **Analytics & Reporting**: Generating SQL-based insights and dashboards.

🎯 Ideal for professionals and students in:
- **Data Engineering**
- **SQL Development**
- **ETL Pipeline Development**
- **Data Analytics**
